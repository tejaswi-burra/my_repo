# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository showcases my **hands-on practice in Machine Learning (ML)**, covering the complete workflow from **data exploration to model training**. It is designed to demonstrate my understanding of ML fundamentals and practical skills.

## **Key Learning Areas**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Inspecting datasets, understanding distributions, handling missing values, and analyzing correlations.  

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, reshaping, and filtering data to make it ML-ready.  

- **Basic Statistics**  
  Mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, max, correlation, and covariance.  

- **Data Visualization**  
  Creating charts and plots to identify patterns and trends in the data.  

- **Model Training Basics**  
  Understanding model selection, splitting data into training/testing sets, and evaluating model performance.  

- **NumPy & Pandas Practice**  
  Practical exercises on arrays, dataframes, vectorized operations, and dataset manipulation for ML workflows.  

## **Purpose of this Repository**
- Build a strong foundation in **ML concepts and data handling**.  
- Demonstrate practical skills for **internships or portfolio projects**.  
- Serve as a reference for **ML preprocessing, visualization, and basic modeling** techniques.  

## **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
